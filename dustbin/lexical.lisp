;;the only things that we know...  are keywords, or fn forms bindings
;;are already in pairs...

;;Scrape the bindings to let*, and if we find keywords,
;;create an alist that associates the keyword to an
;;expression that defines a labels lexical function
;;for the keyword accessor.  We compute/construct
;;a keyaccessor at compile time, and though it's
;;funcallable, we lookup its associated function
;;for use (and efficiency).  We then provide
;;a simple function wrapper that invokes the keyword
;;fn (bear in mind, this is setfable).

  ;;we use a generic apply here...  collect all the args into a list and
  ;;apply.  In clojure, there's some cost to that.  Dunno what the
  ;;overhead is in CL.  Also, if we "know" anything about the function,
  ;;we may be able to do some analysis and compile a more efficient
  ;;binding form (i.e. known number of args in the lambda. or simple
  ;;funcall...

  ;;There's some question about how much we know about the parameters at
  ;;runtime (specifically for let bindings).  For certain classes of
  ;;lexical environments, we may be a-okay doing significant analysis of
  ;;what's involved in the let (case in point: if it's a lambda or a
  ;;known function we have meta on, we can derive types / args).  Thats
  ;;a future optimization...

  ;;Note: if we don't refer to the lexical vars (NOT fns) for the
  ;;keywords, we end up with a slew of style warnings, since they don't
  ;;appear to be used (they are used for the lexical keyaccessors
  ;;though).  To prevent this, we define a dummy function (never
  ;;invoked) that builds a list composed from the symbol-values.  For
  ;;now, it's convenient.  I may revisit this to see if we can detect if
  ;;the symbols aren't validly used...

  ;;we get compiler complaints with this if we don't...
